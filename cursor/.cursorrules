# Cursor AI Assistant Rules

You are an AI assistant helping with code development. Follow these principles and standards.

## Core Principles
- Functional programming over OOP - use pure functions and factory functions
- Exception: Use classes only for performance-critical code with many instances
- Always write clear, concise code with meaningful variable names

## Technical Standards
- Always use TypeScript, never plain JavaScript
- Use named exports only (no default exports)
- File naming: kebab-case by default, PascalCase only for React components

## TypeScript Guidelines
- Prefer interfaces over types (especially when extending)
- Use type unions instead of enums
- Strict mode always enabled
- Write type-safe code with proper type annotations

## React Development
### Framework
- Use React with Vite for new projects
- Use Next.js only when SSR/SSG is specifically needed

### Component Patterns
- Write only functional components with hooks (no class components)
- Define props as interfaces (inline for small, top of file for large)
- Prefer Context API over prop drilling, scope contexts close to consumers
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Implement error boundaries at appropriate levels

### State Management
- Use single useState or useReducer for grouped state changes
- Avoid multiple useState hooks for related state
- For complex state machines, consider XState

### Data Fetching
- Use React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management
- Always handle loading, error, and success states explicitly
- Use mutations for data updates

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS as the default styling solution
- Alternatives when needed: Chakra UI, CSS Modules, Emotion
- Never use styled-components

## Project Structure
- Organize by layers: `/components/`, `/services/`, `/utils/`, `/hooks/`, `/types/`
- Co-locate test files with source: `Button.tsx`, `Button.test.tsx`
- Use `.test.ts(x)` for unit tests, `.spec.ts(x)` for E2E tests

## AI Planning & Design Specs
- Store all AI-oriented planning documents in `/design-specs/` folder
- Include: Feature plans, architecture designs, implementation strategies
- File naming: `feature-name.md` or `module-name-plan.md`
- Purpose: Centralized location for AI coding assistants to reference
- Keep specs updated as implementation evolves

## Development Workflow
- Package manager: Bun
- Build tool: Vite (unless using Next.js)
- Testing: Vitest for unit tests, React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E
- Use AAA pattern for tests: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Don't run tests automatically - developer uses test:watch
- Format with Prettier (default settings)
- Lint with ESLint using eslint.config.js

## Git Workflow
- Create feature branches: `feature/description-kebab-case`
- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Commit messages: Be direct. Avoid overusing words like "Enhanced" or "Enhancing". Simply state what was done
- Run formatters before committing

## Documentation
- Keep documentation concise and scannable
- Write JSDoc comments only when they add value
- Explain "why" not "what" in comments
- Use tables and diagrams over long text blocks
- Avoid using em dashes in documentation and writing

## Communication Style
- Keep responses concise and scannable
- Present only truly viable options
- Make clear recommendations
- Ask specific, targeted questions
- Ask ONE question at a time for better conversation flow

## Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Add ARIA labels when needed
- Support keyboard navigation
- Manage focus in SPAs properly
- Include alt text for images
- Ensure proper color contrast

## Security
- Never expose or log secrets/keys
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Follow security best practices

## UI/UX Standards
- Use sentence case for button text ("Save changes", not "Save Changes")

## Code Quality
- Write clean, self-documenting code
- Avoid premature optimization
- Follow SOLID principles where applicable
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names
