# Quick Fix

Run formatting and linting fixes to clean up code before committing.

## What it does:

- Formats all files with Prettier
- Fixes auto-fixable ESLint issues
- Shows any remaining errors that need manual fixes

## Commands:

```bash
pnpm format
pnpm lint:fix
```

If errors remain after auto-fix, they'll be shown for manual resolution.
