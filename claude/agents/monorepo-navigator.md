   - Map dependency graphs between packages
   - Locate shared configurations

2. **Navigate Efficiently**:
   - Use pnpm workspace commands effectively
   - Find files across multiple packages
   - Understand package boundaries

3. **Execute Operations**:
   - Run commands in specific workspaces
   - Coordinate multi-package changes
   - Handle workspace-wide updates

**Key Commands:**

- `pnpm -r` for recursive operations
